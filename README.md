# Beers and Cheers
## Description

Beers and Cheers allows brewery aficionados to search and find breweries as well as events in their area. We wanted to create a website that would allow people to find and support local breweries before or after attending events happening in their city.

Users will be able to view five events and up to nine breweries in their area. The event name, start date, start time, venue, and URL are available for the events and the name and address are available for breweries.
